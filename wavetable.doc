;   Voice and Waveform data structures:
;
;   |-------|-------|-------|  <- waveform & ctrl points ...
;   A       B       C       D  <- A=Start, B=Loop, C=Endloop, D=End
;
;  A = start of waveform
;  B = loop point
;  C = endloop point
;  D = end of waveform
;
;  L = D-A, length of waveform
;  X = C-A, distance from start to endloop
;  Y = C-B, span of loop (if B=C, it's a one-shot waveform with no loop)
;  Z = D-B, distance from loop point to end of waveform
;
;
;  Information provided by user :-
;
;	DC.L	A	; address of beginning of waveform
;	DC.W	B	; distance from A to B
;	DC.W	C	; distance from A to C
;	DC.W	D	; distance from A to D (length of waveform)
;
;  Data needed by the sequencer, processed by init code or macro:-
;
;	DC.L	A	; address of first sample      (A)	
;	DC.W	L	; length of whole sample (words - for 1shotmode) (D)
;	DC.W	X	; distance from A to C (words) (C)	
;	DC.L	B	; address of first loop sample (A + B)	
;	DC.W	Y	; distance from B to C (words) (C - B)
;	DC.W	Z	; distance from B to D (words) (D - B)
