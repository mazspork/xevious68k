; <ID> is the waveform no. (0-255)
; <volume> is the initial volume (0-64)
; <total> is the total duration, including pause
; <duration> is the duration of the sound (0-65535)
; <rate> is the sample conversion rate, the pitch
; <env> is the amplitude envelope number (1-255, or zero if none)
; <pb> is the frequency envelope number (1-255, or zero if none)
